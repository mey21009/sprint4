# Overview

Right now my app is running in the terminal. My XCode isn't working so I will try it on my sister's computer when I get access to it. I am planning on making this app with a Pass along type game format. In other words the phone would be passed from person to person allowing multiple people to play from the same device. 

I am creating this app at the request of my litle brother. He is on a church mission right now and he had my older sister design a map using the zones for his mission. He casually mentioned a Risk app based on his mission that he could play with us and said that I should make one. The goal this sprint and next is to learn how to make a game like that.

# Development Environment

I have been using VScode and XCode (the later isn't working right now).

I am working eith Swift and have been trying to watch as many youtube videos and read as many how-to guides as possible.
